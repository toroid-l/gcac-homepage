      <p>this is just the homepage for now. the future site of the Glitch City Art Club will be located at <a href="https://communitycenter.glitchcityart.club">communitycenter.glitchcityart.club</a>. once that begins, this page will become a directory that links there, and to other related projects--more public art displays, maybe events, who knows.</p>
